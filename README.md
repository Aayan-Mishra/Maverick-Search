# Maverick-Search üîç
Maverick Search is an open-source AI search engine designed to run locally. Any local model can be used but Maverick models are optimised with this code. Maverick Search uses Exa Search API which more information can be found at [exa.ai](https://exa.ai/). This project is designed to be an open-source alternative to major AI search engines such as Perplexity and etc. While this project is not as accurate or as extensive as certain features whch can be found from other AI providers e.g Perplexity AI's Deep Research, this project aims to replicate that and allow users to run it locally without having to worry about data privacy. Maverick Search can also use other API models from OpenRouter for users that lack the compute to run the Maverick models locally.
